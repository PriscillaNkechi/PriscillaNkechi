ðŸ‘‹Hi, I'm **Priscilla Nkechi Egbo.** 

A graduate of University of Calabar.
I studied **Policy Studies** and **Administration.**

Currently combining my **Policy Analyst** and 
**Administrative** career with **Data Analytics.** Having 
seen that **Policy Making** and **Administration** 
revolves around **Data,** it aroused my curiosity
to go into **Data Analytics.**

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Data Analytics** courses
to gain more knowledge to be able to make informed 
decisions to solve business and personal problems, 
for business growth ðŸ’¹ and expansion using data 
analytics methods and tools.
